SXGE (simple cross-platform opengl es engine) is my attempt at implementing a simple game engine in opengl es 2.0 without using deprecated fixed-function call.

Previously I have only written simple demos so this is my first real opengl project. Therefore, code will be ugly, algorithms will be stupid. Since this is an educational project, I will be implementing everything myself as opposed to using ready-made libraries like glm or qt4.

Right now you need a linux (or, possibly, *BSD) box with mesa GLESv2 and EGL installed or a Mac OS X 10.9
